# Hobby Streamer

This hobby project leverages the AWS Free Tier to build a lightweight CMS and a streaming platform. It allows users to upload videos, manage content, and prepare files for streaming. The goal is to create an end-to-end workflow that covers video ingestion, processing, and delivery with minimal infrastructure cost.

## Tech Stack
	AWS S3 ‚Äì Video storage
	AWS Lambda (Go) ‚Äì Serverless backend logic
    AWS SQS - For Async communication between internal services
	Amazon API Gateway ‚Äì API endpoint management
	AWS Fargate - A transcoder service powered by FFMPEG ‚Äì Video processing and transcoding
	DynamoDB ‚Äì Metadata and CMS data storage
	CloudFront ‚Äì Content delivery (CDN)
	Terraform ‚Äì Infrastructure as code
